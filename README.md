# Task List App 

## Project Summary

A mortgage calculator to determine monthly payment, interest, and total years needed to pay off a mortgage.  The 2nd project from the DOM section of Brad Traversy's Modern Javascript course.  I did not come up with the calculations.  This was more about practicing grabbing and manipulating values and display results to the user.
